Welcome to the GitHub repo for the Living Building Science VIP at Georgia Tech! We are part of the Machine Learning Team, focused on tracking and analzying detection of solitary bees and their swarm patterns at the nest we built for the Kendeda Building (a Living Science Building). For more info on this project, visit our wiki: https://ise.gatech.edu/lbswiki/Machine_Learning. This GitHub was created in Fall 2024 by Me, Paloma Cardozo, and Shanaya Bhurucha. We currently are Computer Science undergraduates at Georgia Tech.
